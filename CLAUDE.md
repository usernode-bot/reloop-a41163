# ReLoop — notes for Claude Code

This app runs on **Homeroom**. If you're Claude Code
editing this repo, read the platform conventions before making
changes:

**Platform conventions (authoritative, always current):**
https://app.onhomeroom.com/claude.md

Fetch that URL at the start of each session — it's the single source
of truth for platform-wide behavior (auth model, `USERNODE_ENV`,
public/private tables, "don't `git push`", etc.). The hosted copy is
updated in place when platform rules change, so fetching it gives you
today's rules, not a stale snapshot.

When running inside Homeroom's dev-chat, those same conventions are
already injected into your system prompt, so the fetch is a no-op in
that path — but it's the right reflex when someone runs Claude Code
against this repo locally or from another harness.

## Connector permission prompts

This repo ships `.claude/settings.json`, which allows the **read-only**
Homeroom connector calls (`mcp__homeroom__get_*`,
`…__list_*`, `…__whoami`) so they stop prompting one at a time. Everything
that acts — filing a request, opening or advancing a proposal — still asks.
Claude Code applies those rules only after you accept the
workspace trust dialog, which lists them for review. See `.claude/README.md`
for the whole story, including what to do if you are still being prompted
(usually: your connector is registered under a different name than the rules
assume).

## Check that this checkout is current

You may be working in a fork of this app whose `main` is behind the app's
canonical repository, and nothing in the checkout says so: `git fetch origin`
compares the fork with itself. This matters before you **read** code to answer
a question about how the app behaves now, not only before you edit it.

The canonical repository is named in `.claude/homeroom-canonical-repo`. Check against
it, not against `origin`:

```sh
git fetch "$(cat .claude/homeroom-canonical-repo)" main
git merge-base --is-ancestor FETCH_HEAD HEAD && echo current || echo behind
```

`behind` means this checkout does not contain the canonical `main`. To answer
a question, read the canonical code instead (`git show FETCH_HEAD:<path>`,
`git grep <pattern> FETCH_HEAD`). To change code, start from the exact base
commit your Homeroom work order gives, and never merge or rebase onto the
canonical `main` yourself: which commit a change is diffed against decides
what the group votes on. With the Homeroom connector, `get_checkout_status`
answers the same question.

A session-start hook (`.claude/hooks/homeroom-freshness.sh`, see `.claude/README.md`) runs
this check for you and tells you when you are behind. It is silent offline, so
its silence is not proof the checkout is current. Inside Homeroom's dev-chat
the platform fixes the base commit, and none of this applies.

## Starter template

The screen this app currently ships — the hero, the "What's already
working" card, and the Press! example (the demo markup in
`public/index.html`, the `/api/press` and `/api/leaderboard` routes, and
the `presses` table bootstrap in `server.js`) — is placeholder content
from the Homeroom starter template, not product intent.

When the user asks for their first real feature, REPLACE the template
screen rather than building alongside it:

- remove the `usernode-starter-notice@1` block in `public/index.html`
  (both sentinel comments and everything between them),
- remove or repurpose the "Try the example" card, its demo endpoints and
  the `presses` table as appropriate,
- rewrite `README.md` to describe the actual app.

Keep the `usernode-dev-console@1` forwarder `<script>` when rewriting the
HTML — that block is platform infrastructure, not template content. So is
the bridge `<script>`. The design kit is not placeholder either: build the
real app with it, and fill in "## Design" below.

The screen has a light and a dark look and follows the viewer's Homeroom
theme, switching live when they change it: the theme `<script>` right after
the bridge tag sets a `dark` class on `<html>`. Keep that script, and give
everything you build both looks (the design kit's colour tokens carry both), unless one
fixed look is the point of this app, like a game's own scene; then say so
under "## Design" below. Unless a request asks for one, add
no theme picker: the viewer's Homeroom setting is the control. "The
platform's light/dark theme inside the app frame" in the platform
conventions has the details.

If a rule below this line conflicts with the hosted conventions, the
hosted conventions win. This file is **app-specific** — write down
things about *this* app that belong in the repo: product intent,
data-model quirks, style preferences, opt-in policies (e.g. which
tables you've marked private), etc.

## About ReLoop

Digital waste bank app for neighborhoods to track and manage recyclable waste.
Each household keeps a waste bank book: members deposit plastic, paper,
metal, glass or other waste by weight, the app converts each deposit to
points (1 per full kilogram), and everyone sees the members' running
balances, replacing the ledger waste banks usually keep on paper.

## Design

This app's look. The first real version fills in the blanks; every later
change follows it, and updates it when a request changes the look on purpose.

- **Palette:** the kit's defaults, kept: accent teal, warm stone neutrals.
  Both looks already pass contrast; do not introduce other colours.
- **Signature element:** the small circular-arrows loop mark beside the
  "ReLoop" title (inline SVG in the accent colour), echoing recycling.
  Nothing else on screen is decorative.
- **Type scale:** `text-title`, `text-heading`, `text-body`, `text-small`
  (unchanged; do not change their sizes in `tailwind.config.js`).
- Words: Household, Member, Waste type, Weight (kg), Deposit, Points,
  Balances. Waste types are always written Plastic, Paper, Metal, Glass,
  Other. Kilograms show one decimal ("3.4 kg"); points are whole numbers
  ("12 points").

The kit is in `styles/tailwind-input.css`: colour tokens with a light and
a dark value (named in `tailwind.config.js`), and a few components
(`btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `field`, `list` and `list-row`,
`card`, `section-label`, `skeleton`, `state-empty`, `state-error`).
Re-theme by changing the token values there, keeping every text pair at
4.5:1 or more in both looks.

- Colour comes only from the tokens (`bg-ground`, `bg-surface`,
  `text-fg`, `text-muted`, `border-line`, `bg-accent` with
  `text-on-accent`, ...): never a raw hex value or a stock palette class.
- Tap targets are at least 44 px; the buttons and fields already are.
- Every screen that loads data has honest loading, empty and error states.
  Never show the empty state while loading or after a failure; an error says
  what failed, what still works, and offers Retry.
- Seed obviously fake staging demo data so the populated screen can be seen
  ("Staging mock data" in the platform conventions).
- No cards in cards, no uppercase eyebrows, no emoji as icons.

## App-specific conventions

- Weights are stored as integer grams (`deposits.weight_grams`), never
  floats; the screen converts to kilograms for display.
- `households`, `members` and `deposits` are append-only: no `UPDATE` or
  `DELETE` anywhere. A deposit, once written, is permanent.
- Points are `Math.floor(weight_grams / 1000)` at insert time — 1 per full
  kilogram; a deposit under a full kilogram earns no points yet, and
  fractions do not carry over between deposits.
- Waste types are exactly `plastic`, `paper`, `metal`, `glass`, `other`
  (stored lowercase).
- Everyone belongs to exactly one household (`members.user_id` is UNIQUE);
  there is no leaving or switching household yet.
- Avoid adding new dependencies.
